# Weather and Medication Alert App

Welcome to the documentation for my weather and medication alert app! This app aims to provide real-time notifications about changes in the weather to me using a React Native App! This is my first full project using React Native and test-driven development

## Motivation

I suffer from weather induced migraines and hayfever but I often find that I forget to take my medication before I get symptoms, hence I have created this app! The aim is that notifications will appear on my phone prior to migraine or hayfever triggers to notify me to take my preventative medication.
